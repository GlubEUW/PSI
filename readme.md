# PSI Team Project


## Funtionality list:
- **Link based invite system**  
Each separate game session will have it's own unique web URL which can be copied and sent to other users in order for them to join the same game session.

- **Matchmaking**  
The user has the ability to join a matchmaking queue which will search for other people who are currently waiting in a matchmaking queue for the same game. Once enough players are in a matchmaking queue for the same game, they are matched together. In theory, different users will be able to get matched with random people from the internet.  
*Examples: League of Legends, Counter Strike, Valorant, etc.*

- **Account management**  
The user can set up an account which will store and track his game data (win/loss ratio in certain games, longest win/lose streak).

- **Guest user**  
The user isn't required to make an account in order to play games, a username is enough.

- **Account management**  
If the user creates an account, he is able to view his stats, change his name or password.

- **Game data**  
Game data will be collected and stored in a database for each game (games played, games won / lost/ winrate).

- **Player data**  
Users' match history and other game data will be stored in a database.

- **Leaderboard**  
A leaderboard ranking users with the most wins (or highest winrate percentage), updated live.

- **Tournament bracket**  
Users are able to queue for a tournament session which will have the players compete with on another for placements in a tournament style bracket.

- **Turn-based games**  
Mini games will be made on the basis of each player having to wait for his turn to make a move in the game.
