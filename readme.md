# PSI Team Project


## Funtionality list:
- **Link based invite system**  
Each separate game session will have it's own unique web URL which can be copied and sent to other users in order for them to join the same game session.

- **Matchmaking**  
A user has the ability to join a matchmaking queue which will search for other people who are currently waiting in a matchmaking queue for the same game. Once enough players are in a matchmaking queue for the same game, they are matched together. In theory, different users will be able to get matched with random people from the internet.  
*Examples: League of Legends, Counter Strike, Valorant, etc.*
